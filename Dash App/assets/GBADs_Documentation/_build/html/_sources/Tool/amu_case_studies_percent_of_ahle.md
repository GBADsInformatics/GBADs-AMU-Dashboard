# Percent of the Animal Health Loss Envelope

The percentage of AHLE chart illustrates the relative distribution of the financial burden associated with Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and Animal Health Loss Equivalents (AHLE) within a specific disease context, under a given incident rate of resistance for that disease. 
The chart visually represents the total AHLE, partitioned into AMR-related components and the remaining portion as unattributed AHLE. 
The chart highlights the proportional contribution of the AMR components, emphasizing the relative significance of each source of economic burden.

The controls for the percentage of AHLE chart are:
