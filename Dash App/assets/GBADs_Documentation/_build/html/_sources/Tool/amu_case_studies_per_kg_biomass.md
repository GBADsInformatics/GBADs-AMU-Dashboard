# Burden per KG Biomass

This chart presents the financial burden of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and Animal Health Loss Envelope (AHLE) per kilogram of biomass within a specific disease context, under a given incident rate of resistance for that disease. 
The chart visually represents the total AHLE per kilogram, partitioned into the AMR contributing components and the remaining portion, labeled as the unattributed AHLE. 
Error bars indicate the range of uncertainty associated with these per-kilogram estimates. 
The data reflects the overall economic burden per kilogram at a specific production stage, offering insight into the financial implications of AMR and AHLE per unit of biomass within this scenario.

The controls for the absolute burden chart are:

**Currency**<br />
Determines the currency to display. Currency exchange rate is from the World Bank and is specific to the displayed year.

**Incident rate of resistance**<br />
Scenarios represent varying disease incident rates. Use this control to see how different rates influence the data.
