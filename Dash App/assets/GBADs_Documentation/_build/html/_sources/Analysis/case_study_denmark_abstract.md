<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
This study quantifies the economic burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD) in Danish pig production in 2022, particularly for the breeding and nursery stages, through application of an analytical framework developed by the Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) programme. First, the animal health loss envelope (AHLE) was estimated. This metric evaluates the burden of all health hazards by comparing the financial performance in the current situation to an ideal scenario where the impact of health hazards is removed. Then, an attribution step was performed to resistance in PWD cases using a stochastic model to populate two scenarios based on distinct incidence: (1) a deterministic 5% incidence based on expert opinion and (2) a distribution of incidence values derived from antimicrobial usage data retrieved from VetStat. Farm-level results were extrapolated at national scale.

<p>
The AHLE for the breeding and nursery components of the Danish pig sector in 2022 was estimated at around € 743 million, with AMR in PWD accounting for 2.1% and 3.3% in scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Production losses and antimicrobial expenditures contributed unevenly to the burden (24.8% and 75.2% for scenario 1 and 14.5% and 85.5% for scenario 2). This relatively low contribution of AMR in PWD to the AHLE is not surprising and could be explained by the production practice involving all-in-all-out at nursery stage, specific pathogen-free conditions and high biosecurity standards, which help to counter disease pressure in intensive pig production. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the economic burden of AMR in pigs in Denmark and establishes the starting point for future burden work, benchmarking and developing cost-effectiveness analysis for mitigation actions. The results also highlight critical data gaps and the need for improved epidemiological and socio-economic data capturing systems in livestock, to improve future assessments.
