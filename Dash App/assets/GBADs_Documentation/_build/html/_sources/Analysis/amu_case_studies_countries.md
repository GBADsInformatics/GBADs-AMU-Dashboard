Conceptual flow of AMR burden
```

<p>
The burden of antimicrobia resistance (AMR) is represented in the conceptual flow above. 
Aspects of AMR that are accounted for in the analysis are labeled with 'AMR' while remaining components of the animal health loss envelope (AHLE) are labeled 'Unattributed AHLE'.
</p>

<h3>Denmark</h3>
<p>
The case study for Demark is exploring the burden of antimicrobial resistance in post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in swine in the context of AHLE. 
This is shown as a total across all swine as well as broken out by the 3 different farm types: breeding, nursing, and fattening. 
<p>
The estimate of the burden of antimicrobial resistance is broken out by 2 sources: production losses and health expenditure. 
The uncertanity in the estimate is displayed in the graphics with error bars.

<h3>Ethiopia</h3>
<p>
The case study for Ethiopia is exploring the burden of antimicrobial resistance in mastitis in cattle in the context of AHLE. 
This is shown as a total across all production systems as well as comparing mastitis to antimicrobial resistant mastitis. 
<p>
The estimate of the burden of antimicrobial resistance is broken out by 3 sources: production losses, health expenditure, and indirect costs. 
The uncertanity in the estimate is displayed in the graphics with error bars.
