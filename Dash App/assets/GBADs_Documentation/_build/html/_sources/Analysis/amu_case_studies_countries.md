Conceptual flow of AMR burden
```

<p>
The burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is represented in the conceptual flow above. 
Aspects of AMR that are accounted for in the analysis are labelled with 'AMR' while remaining components of the animal health loss envelope (AHLE), currently not attributed, are labelled 'Unattributed AHLE'.
</p>

<h3>Denmark</h3>
<p>
The case study for Demark is exploring the burden of antimicrobial resistance in post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD) in the pig sector in the context of AHLE, in 2022. 
This is shown as a total, as well as broken down by the three stages of production: breeding, nursing, and fattening.
<p>
The estimate of the burden of antimicrobial resistance is broken down into two loss pathways: production losses and health expenditure. 
The uncertainty in the estimate is displayed in the graphics with error bars.

<h3>Ethiopia</h3>
<p>
The case study for Ethiopia is exploring the burden of antimicrobial resistance in clinical mastitis in cattle in the context of AHLE, in 2021. 
This is shown as a total across all production systems, as well as broken down by production system.
<p>
he estimate of the burden of antimicrobial resistance is broken out by three loss pathways: production losses, health expenditure, and indirect costs. 
The uncertainty in the estimate is displayed in the graphics with error bars.
