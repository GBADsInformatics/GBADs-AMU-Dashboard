<p>
The primary goal of this work is to estimate the global expenditure on antimicrobials used for livestock, as this is an important component of the burden of disease.

A secondary goal is to display antimicrobial resistance in the context of the burden within the animal health loss envelope. This is done with case studies from two countries, Denmark and Ethiopia, exploring specific diseases and species.
